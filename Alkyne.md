# Nomenclature
## Conditions
1) Find the longest chain of carbon atoms
2) Outside the chain there is substitutes
3) Numbering from the nearer side of triple bond
4) Naming should be in alphabetical order
5) Write first substituent then chain name
6) If same thing is repeated twice, 'di' will be prefix & so on
7) Between number and number there is coma
8) Between number and word there is dash
